Mask Detection Algorithm

Introduction:

   Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 2019, the primary emphasis of governments around the world has been to prevent its spread. Before the Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020, the only defense against the virus was to avoid contracting it. At the time, due to the relative lack of knowledge regarding the virus, various methods of prevention were employed. These included the use of N95 rated face masks, medical face masks, face shields, the use of alcohol and other disinfectants, as well as social distancing.
   
   While some are still skeptical about the use of face masks, evidence based study has proven its effectiveness of using face masks in avoiding the spread of the virus. (https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118)
